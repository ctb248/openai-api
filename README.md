# OpenAI API Quickstart - Node.js example app

Just a simple fork of the NextJS demo for messing around with the OpenAI API. Adds a basic chat interface for freeform interaction with a text model. Also implements the Whisper API to record and transcribe user audio messages, as well as the Google Cloud text-to-speech API to narrate bot responses.
